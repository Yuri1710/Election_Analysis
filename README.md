# Election_Analysis
*Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.*
>Our object for these project "Election-Audit" is to provide to our public the results of our compaigne and know who was the winning candidate.  :man_technologist:

*Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.*



With the explanation shared in these module, Visual Code was a very helpful tool for us, since it's a source code editor that makes our day to day more easier to work with. 

We managed to obtain :

- Total of votes for our compaigne.
- Votes por Counties.
- Our County with more participation.
- Top 3 candidates.
- Total of votes won per candidate.
- Percentage of votes won per candidate.

Example of our formula we used to obtain our percentage was:

- **vote_percentage = float(votes) / float(total_votes) * 100**


The complete formula applied was:

*How many votes were cast in this congressional election?*

We received a positive participation of votes from society,where we had a ***total of votes for 369,711***.



*Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.*

We managed to compile a database of 36911 rows, were we needed to apply a _"for"_ formula to obtain our top 3 "counties", such as total of votes per county and percentage represented.

**County Votes:**

1. Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
2. Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
3. Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

*Which county had the largest number of votes?*

###### The Largest County Turnout was: ***Denver***

*Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.*

- **Charles Casper Stockham: _23.0%_ (85,213)**
- **Diana DeGette: _73.8%_ (272,892)**
- **Raymon Anthony Doane: _3.1%_ (11,606)**

*Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?*

As we can see our candidate Diana DeGette was the winner in these compaigne being on the front for more than 73% of total votes.

- **Winner: Diana DeGette**
- **Winning Vote Count: 272,892**
- **Winning Percentage: 73.8%**

Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

One of the best things of using these script is that we're able to edit as many times as needed, such as it will speed up our day to day, using these script in Visual Studio Code will also help us to personalize for future compaignes or projects.
